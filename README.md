# System Wizard Guidebook (SWiG)

Just getting started on creating a guidebook that contains useful commands for everything from windows to linux to networking. This guidebook is organized not by command, but by the action you intend to do on the system (windows, linux, network, etc).&#x20;

Why?&#x20;

I believe that many aspiring cyber security experts, including myself, fall into a couple of the same pitfalls. The first pitfall is that we take a different sets of notes for each class that we take, sometimes storing those notes in different locations. The second pitfall is that we learn new commands and group our notes by each command rather than by the intended outcome or action. The third pitfall is that we take extensive, verbose notes on each topic that we learn, thinking that we will go back and actually read all of that each time we are working something to do with that topic.

This guidebook will address these problems and hopefully help cyber security experts and system admins to avoid these traps. This guidebook is nearly everything I know, but in a compact and easy to digest format. It's grouped by intended action, rather than command. At a glance, you can see a variety of options to execute that action, whether it be something as simple as copying a file to something more advanced or specific.

The workflow would look something like this: You want to find information about a process on Linux system. You open the System Wizard Guidebook (SWiG) and go to Unix -> System Ops -> Processes -> Enumerate From here you can see your options on how to move forward. Well-known commands such as ps and maybe some commands you did not know about such as pidof or pgrep.

In my opinion, being able to see what my options are allows me to put my energy towards an effective solution, rather than trying to remember all of the random commands I have learned throughout the years. It's easy to forget about a command like <mark style="color:red;">`pgrep`</mark> when I have only used it a handful of times. That's how many things are in the cyber field. You learn a cool trick for a specific problemset and then you do not need it for months, sometimes years. But, when that time comes, you can either relearn that trick each time, or just search it in your notes and execute.

After years of falling in to that same pattern, I finally learned how important it is to maintain proper notes. Proper notes being notes that are easy to parse, easy to search through and find what you are looking for, and easy to add more notes to it.

I spent months going through all of my notes scattered in the ether and organized them in one location. Then I reformatted the notes to be easy to read and search through. Then I found a better format, so I did it again. And again. I want to share my notes with everyone, because I do not want other people learn this lesson the hard way.

I believe the System Wizard Guidebook will give new and aspiring cyber experts a headstart in their career. They will have a knowledge base and a note-taking structure to build from, while avoiding the common pitfalls.
