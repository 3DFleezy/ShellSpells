# ShellSpells

## <mark style="color:red;">What is ShellSpells?</mark>

ShellSpells was created for three reasons:

* A command-line toolkit for Linux, Windows, Networking, and more, that categorizes commands by their intended action, rather than by specific commands.
* A note repository for cybersecurity beginners and professionals to start with, or expand on, while avoiding common pitfalls when it comes to taking notes ([more on that below](./#what-pitfalls)).
* I wanted to share this resource for free with the community.

{% hint style="info" %}
ShellSpells consists of mostly system administration commands, but does lean a little towards penetration testing and security in some areas. However, this resource is useful to anyone working in the IT/cybersecurity industry.

If you are looking for pentesting techniques and exploits, make sure to check out [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/).&#x20;

A big shoutout to Carlos Polop and the HackTricks team for the spectacular resource, and also for the inspiration to create ShellSpells.

If you work in penetration testing or cybersecurity, using ShellSpells along with HackTricks is a strong combo.

## <mark style="color:red;">Why Categorize Commands by Intended Action?</mark>

When you are in the middle of doing a task, it is easier to search through your notes based on the desired outcome/intended action rather than trying to remember all the available commands and their various switches.&#x20;

Think of all the different commands to enumerate a process. How many different sections of your notes would you have to search through if they were categorized by command? ShellSpells provides a different method.

Workflow Example:\
If you want to enumerate a process on Windows, you would go to\
\
Windows -> System Ops -> Processes -> Enumerate\
\
At a glance you now have a plethora of commands to accomplish the task, to include CMD, PowerShell, and wmic commands. All in one place, in an easy-to-read format, and easy to locate. On top of that, you will see other options you can use.

* It is efficient.
* It takes seconds rather than minutes to find what you are looking for.
* It helps stay on task.

Ultimately, you can spend more brain cycles on developing an effective solution to your problem/task, rather than trying to remember or locate commands.



## <mark style="color:red;">What Pitfalls?</mark>

In summary, these are the pitfalls I see in this industry.

* Taking separate notes for each class (and never moving them to a central note repository)
* Taking notes in a multiple applications (and never moving them to a central note repository)
* Taking command line notes categorized by commands rather than by intended action.
* Taking very verbose notes on everything.

Throughout my career, I personally tested each one of these pitfalls...

By the time I realized my mistakes and started to move my notes to a central location, it took a long time for me to gather everything together. It took longer for me to re-organize my notes in to an effective format.

I created this resource to help others avoid the mistakes that I made while also providing a useful command line toolkit and note repository to the community.

If you are new to the cyber career field, then I believe this resource is a **head start**. If I had this when I was first getting started it would have been a game-changer. I encourage you to fork it and build on it as you grow your skills. Understand the importance of taking effective, organized notes. It is one of those things that separates the pros from the average joes.

## <mark style="color:red;">Work in Progress:</mark>

ShellSpells always has been, and always will be a work in progress.

I'll continue to add new things to this resource as I learn them. \
I'll continue to make corrections as I find them. \
